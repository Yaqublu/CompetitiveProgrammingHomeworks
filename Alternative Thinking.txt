Alternative Thinking

if in our array a[i]!=a[i-1], then we do not need to change them, because it will not affect the result. Lets look at example: for '10101' we will find 4 where str[i]!=str[i-1]. But length is 5. So we initialize s=1. It does not matter how long will be our contiguous non-empty substring because it only will add to our alternating subsequence 2 more {1,0}. So s will be s+2. As the length can be increase n (length of our initial array), we will take min(n, s).

we will scan our array once that will take O(n) time.
