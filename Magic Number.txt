Magic Number

It is better to start look to each character of our string ('str') from right to left.
-if the character str[i] is equal 4 then:
   -if (s[i-1]==4 and s[i-2]==1) or if s[i-1]==1, then we can continue to search
   -Otherwise, it is not magic number
-Also if s[i]==1, we can continue to search
-Otherwise, it is not magic number

In the worse case, we will scan all the characters of our string, that will take O(n) time.
