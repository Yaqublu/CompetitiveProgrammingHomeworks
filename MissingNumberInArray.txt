MissingNumberInArray

We know that the sum of elements from 1 to n is (1+n)*n/2 . By subtracting the sum of the elements in the array that contains elements from 1 to n with one missing from this sum will give us that missing number.

We will spend O(n) time for calculating the sum of the element in the array and O(1) constant time for finding the missing number.
