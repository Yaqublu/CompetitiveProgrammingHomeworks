First of all, if our graph is bipartite graph then there should not be a path from vertex u to u. So if G[u][u]==1 then ve return false.
For every vertex u, we check if there is an edge to any other vertex v and it does not have color then we give it a new color. However, if that vertex v has already been colored and its color is same as vertex u, then we return false.

We will check the connection of each vertex with others and with itself. So it will take O(V*V), where V is number of vertices
