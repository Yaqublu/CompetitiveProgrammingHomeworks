Let say we are looking for F(n). Then, by taking any F(n-1) where digits number are n-1 and by appending a 1, or by taking any F(n-2) where digits number are n-2 and by appending 01 will us F(n). Thus, F(N) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2). Also, it is clear that F(1) = 2 and F(0) = 1. As we are working with big numbers it is better to save all digits of our number in an array and do adding operation with arrays.

It will take O(n) time for finding F(n).
