Leaders in an array

The best way of finding all leader elements in the array, which are greater than all the elements to its right side, is to start from the right end of the array. It is clear that the last element A[n-1] is the Leader element, as there is no element in its right side. Let's take a variable 'max' and give initial value as -1 (it is ensured that all elements are not less than 0). Then by scanning all the elements from right to left in the given array, if the element A[i] is greater than 'max' we change the value of 'max' to A[i] and save it in a stack. By printing all elements of the stack in a reverse order we will get Leaders in our given array.

We scan elements of array once, so this algorithm will take linear time O(n)
